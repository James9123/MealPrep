Should work on adding styles or adding a few more meals to the database

# Requirements:
* The application allows the user to view a list of available meals (with image, title, description, and option to add to meal plan)
* The application has a carousel to highlight some meal images
* The user can go to “My Meals” to see all the Meals added to the plan, then the user can “generate” a meal plan (with a name and notes) -- that can be downloaded as a PDF (probably).

* (extra if there is time and you're feeling advanced) Navigate through meals via categories or filters
* (extra if there is time and you're feeling advanced) Log in/Log out
